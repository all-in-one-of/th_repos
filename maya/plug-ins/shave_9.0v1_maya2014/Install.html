<h2 align="center"><a name="linux">Installing Shave And A Haircut On Linux</a></h2>

<p>
<h3><a name="before-linux">Before Installation</a></h3>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut for Linux comes in a RedHat Package Manager (RPM)
file, with a name ending in <i>.rpm</i>.  E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    shaveHaircut_Maya2008_0-5.0-44.i686.rpm
	<br>
    shaveHaircut_Maya2008_0_64-5.0-44.x86_64.rpm
</div>
<p>
The first is the version for 32-bit Maya, the second is the version for
64-bit Maya.
<p>
Make sure that the Maya version given in the filename matches the version
of Maya for which you are installing Shave And A Haircut (e.g. '2008_0' for
32-bit Maya 2008, or '2008_0_64' for 64-bit Maya 2008).
For the remainder of this document we will assume that you are
installing Shave And A Haircut for 32-bit Maya 2008.  If not, please
remember to adjust the version numbers in any filenames or commands
presented here to match your version of Maya.
<p>
If any users on the system are currently running Maya, have them exit until
the installation is complete.

<p>
<h3><a name="install-linux">Installing Shave And A Haircut</a></h3>
<p>
To install Shave And A Haircut, use the <i>rpm</i> command as follows:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    rpm -U shaveHaircut_Maya2008_0-5.0-44.i686.rpm
</div>

<p>
<h3><a name="mr-linux">Installing Mental Ray Standalone Support</a></h3>
<p>
Maya allows scenes to be exported as <i>.mi</i> files which can then be
rendered using a standalone Mental Ray renderer.
<p>
To have Shave And A Haircut support this workflow, copy the following file
to the <i>lib</i> subdirectory of your standalone Mental Ray installation:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    /usr/autodesk/maya2008/mentalray/lib/shaveMRShader.so
</div>
<p>
and copy the following file to the <i>include</i> subdirectory of your
standalone Mental Ray installation:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    /usr/autodesk/maya2008/mentalray/include/shaveMRShader.mi
</div>

<p>
<h3><a name="load-linux">Loading The Plugin</a></h3>
<p>
To use Shave And A Haircut from within Maya, bring up Maya's <i>Plug-in
Manager</i>, which can be found on the Maya menubar under <i>Window :
Settings/Preferences : Plug-in Manager</i>.
<p>
The Plug-in Manager will display its plugins in several sections.  Shave
And A Haircut will have its own section, bearing a name something like
this:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    /usr/autodesk/maya/2008/modules/JoeAlter/plug-ins/
</div>
<p>
Beneath that heading you should see an entry for the <i>shaveNode.so</i>
file with two checkboxes to the right of it, marked <i>loaded</i> and
<i>auto load</i>.
<p>
To load Shave And A Haircut, check the <i>loaded</i> box.  To have Shave
And A Haircut automatically load whenever you start up Maya, also check the
<i>auto load</i> box.

<p>
<h3><a name="uninstall-linux">Uninstalling Shave And A Haircut</a></h3>
<p>
To uninstall Shave And A Haircut, make yourself the superuser and use the
<i>rpm</i> command as follows:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    rpm -e shaveHaircut_Maya2008_0
</div>
<p>
Note that if, during installation, you copied files by hand as described in
<a href="#mr-linux">Installing Mental Ray Standalone Support</a>, then you
will have to remove those files by hand.
<p>

<p>
<h3><a name="remote-linux">Remote Installation</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>rpm</i> tool used to install Shave And A Haircut is a command line
tool with no user interaction required.  As such it is well suited
to remote and unattended installation.  Simply copy Shave And A Haircut's
<i>.rpm</i> file to the remote system, or to a network drive visible to the
remote system, then use the <i>rsh</i> command to run <i>rpm</i> on the
remote system.

<p>
<h3><a name="relocate-linux">Relocating Files</a></h3>
<p>
For most users the standard locations used by Shave for its components
will be sufficient.  However, some users with special needs may need to
relocate some or all of Shave's components to different locations on their
computer's disks, or on a network.
<p>
This section lists the various categories of files included in the
Shave And A Haircut installation, their default locations, and how to go
about relocating them to different directories.


<h4>Base Plugin And Scripts (required)</h4>
<p>
On Linux Shave And A Haircut is shipped as a Maya module.  This means that
there is a module definition file which points to a special directory tree
containing most of the files required by Shave And A Haircut.
Unfortunately, Maya does not yet support the modularization of runtime
libraries, presets, Mental Ray for Maya shaders or shader icons, so those
elements of the plugin must be dealt with separately.
<p>
The module definition file for Shave And A Haircut is named
<i>shaveHaircut.mod</i> and is located in Maya's module directory.
For example:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  /usr/autodesk/maya/2008/modules/shaveHaircut.mod
</div>
<p>
By default, the module file will point to the <i>JoeAlter/shaveHaircut</i>
tree within that same module directory:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  /usr/autodesk/maya/2008/modules/JoeAlter/shaveHaircut
</div>
<p>
Beneath that directory lie four subdirectories, containing the base
plug-ins, scripts, icons and Shave API sample files:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  /usr/autodesk/maya/2008/modules/JoeAlter/shaveHaircut/plug-ins
  <br>
  /usr/autodesk/maya/2008/modules/JoeAlter/shaveHaircut/scripts
  <br>
  /usr/autodesk/maya/2008/modules/JoeAlter/shaveHaircut/icons
  <br>
  /usr/autodesk/maya/2008/modules/JoeAlter/shaveHaircut/samples
</div>
<p>
All except the sample files are required for the proper operation of Shave
And A Haircut.
<p>
The easiest way to relocate these files is to move the entire sub-tree, as
a unit, and modify the path in the <i>shaveHaircut.mod</i> file to point to
the new location.
<p>
The <i>shaveHaircut.mod</i> file itself may be relocated to any directory
in the user's <a href="#mayaVars">MAYA_MODULE_PATH</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, the files in the <i>plug-ins</i> subdirectory may be moved
to any directory which is in the user's <a
href="#mayaVars">MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH</a>, the files in the <i>scripts</i>
subdirectory to any directory in the user's <a
href="#mayaVars">MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH</a>, and the files in the <i>icons</i>
subdirectory to any directory in the user's <a
href="#mayaVars">XBMLANGPATH</a>.  The files in the <i>samples</i>
subdirectory can go wherever you like.


<h4>Base Runtime Library (required)</h4>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut installs a library named <i>libShave.so</i> to
which it must have access at runtime.  By default this file is placed in
Maya's <i>lib</i> directory along with Maya's own runtime libraries.  E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  /usr/autodesk/maya2008/lib/libShave.so
</div>
<p>
You may relocate this library to any directory in the user's
<a href="#mayaVars">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</a>
<p>


<h4>Icons (recommended)</h4>
<p>
Some versions of Maya do not allow render node and button icons to be
stored within the module tree, so Shave And A Haircut installs them
into Maya's own <i>icons</i> directory. E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
	/usr/autodesk/maya2008/icons
</div>
<p>
Icon files whose names begin with either <i>shave</i> or <i>render_shave</i>
are part of the Shave And A Haircut plugin.
<p>
If these files are not present Maya will print warnings and buttons on the
Shave shelf will be displayed with a blank icon, as will any Shave-specific
buttons on the Hypershade and Create Render Node windows.  Other than that,
both Shave And A Haircut and Maya will still function properly.
<p>
In Maya 6.5 these files must remain in Maya's own <i>icons</i> directory.
In Maya 7.0 and later they can be relocated to any directory in the user's
<a href="#mayaVars">XBMLANGPATH</a>.
<p>


<h4>Presets (recommended)</h4>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut includes a number of preset files which can be used to
quickly create hair with certain predefined looks, such as blond, grass,
scruffy, etc.  Each preset consists of a MEL script file and an XPM image
file containing a sample swatch.
<p>
These presets are intended to be available to all users on the system and
are normally stored with the rest of Maya's system-wide presets in a
directory relative to Maya's installation directory.  So for Maya 2008
the default location of the script file for Shave's <i>grass</i> preset
would be:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
	/usr/autodesk/maya2008/presets/attrPresets/shaveHair/grass.mel
</div>
<p>
When searching for these built-in presets Shave And A Haircut looks in the
following directories, in the order listed, from top to bottom:
<p>
<ul>
<li>${SHAVE_COMMON_PRESET_PATH}</li>
<li>${SHAVE_LOCATION}/presets/attrPresets/shaveHair</li>
<li>${MAYA_PRESET_PATH}/attrPresets/shaveHair</li>
<li>${MAYA_LOCATION}/presets/attrPresets/shaveHair</li>
</ul>
<p>
The syntax <i>${NAME}</i> refers to the expansion of the environment
variabled named <i>NAME</i>. Note that <i>${MAYA_PRESET_PATH}</i> may
expand to a list of directories in which case each is checked in turn.
<p>


<h4>Mental Ray Shaders (optional)</h4>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut's support for Mental Ray for Maya involves three files:
a shader definition file called <i>shaveMRShader.mi</i>, a shader library
file called <i>shaveMRShader.so</i>, and the Mental Ray for Maya startup
file which is called <i>maya.rayrc</i>.  These files are installed within
the <i>mentalray</i> hierarchy beneath Maya's own installation directory.
For Maya 2008, the files would be located as
follows:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  /usr/autodesk/maya2008/mentalray/include/shaveMRShader.mi
  <br>
  /usr/autodesk/maya2008/mentalray/lib/shaveMRShader.so
  <br>
  /usr/autodesk/maya2008/mentalray/maya.rayrc
</div>
<p>
The first two files are installed by Shave And A Haircut.  The third is
installed by Maya and modified by the Shave And A Haircut installer.  They
are only required if you wish to use Mental Ray for Maya to render scenes
containing hair generated by Shave And A Haircut.
<p>
The locations of these files are mandated by Maya and, to the best of our
knowledge, they cannot be relocated elsewhere except by moving all of Maya.
<p>
Shave And A Haircut also installs icons for its Mental Ray shaders into
Maya's own <i>icons</i> directory.  E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    /usr/autodesk/maya2008/icons/render_shaveMRHairComp.xpm
	<br>
    /usr/autodesk/maya2008/icons/render_shaveMRHairGeom.xpm
	<br>
    /usr/autodesk/maya2008/icons/render_shaveMRHairGeomDRA.xpm
	<br>
    /usr/autodesk/maya2008/icons/render_shaveMRHairIllum.xpm
	<br>
    /usr/autodesk/maya2008/icons/render_shaveMRHairShadows.xpm
	<br>
    /usr/autodesk/maya2008/icons/render_shaveMRRenderComp.xpm
	<br>
    /usr/autodesk/maya2008/icons/render_shaveMRVertexIllum.xpm
</div>
<p>
If these files are not present, the corresponding shaders will be displayed
with blank icons in the Hypershade and Create Render Node windows.  Also,
the first time one of those windows is opened, Maya will display warning
messages for each missing icon.  Other than that, both Shave And A Haircut
and Maya will function properly whether or not the files are present.
<p>
In Maya 6.5 these files must remain in Maya's own <i>icons</i> directory.
In Maya 7.0 and later they can be relocated to any directory in the user's
<a href="#mayaVars">XBMLANGPATH</a>.
<p>


<h4>RenderMan Shaders (optional)</h4>
<p>
Shave has a single RenderMan shader called <i>Shave.slo</i>
which is installed into the <i>plug-ins/prman/lib/shaders</i> directory
in the Shave installation tree. For example:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  /usr/autodesk/maya/2008/modules/JoeAlter/shaveHaircut/plug-ins/prman/lib/shaders/Shave.slo
</div>
<p>
By default Shave looks for this shader relative to the location of its
plugin file, <i>shaveNode.so</i>, which normally sits in the
<i>plug-ins</i> directory of the path given above. So if you move
<i>shaveNode.so</i> to a different directory then you should move the
<i>prman</i> directory there as well.
<p>
Alternatively, you can move the <i>Shave.slo</i> file itself into the
<i>lib/shaders</i> subdirectory of any directory in the user's
<a href="#mayaVars">RMSTREE</a>.


<h4>Shave API Plugins (optional)</h4>
<p>
Third-party plugins developed using the Shave And A Haircut API will
require the presence of the <i>libShaveAPI.so</i> runtime library, which by
default can be found in Maya's own <i>lib</i> directory.  E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  /usr/autodesk/maya2008/lib/libShaveAPI.so
</div>
<p>
If you are using third-party plugins built with the Shave And A Haircut API
and need to relocate this file, the directory to which you relocate it must
be in the user's <a href="#mayaVars">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</a>.
<p>
Note that Shave And A Haircut does not itself use this file.
<p>


<h4>Shave API Development (optional)</h4>
<p>
Developers wishing to create their own plugins which use the Shave And A
Haircut API will need access to the <i>libShaveAPI.so</i> runtime library
described in the previous section, as well as its associated header file,
<i>shaveAPI.h</i>.  By default this header file is located within Maya's
own <i>include</i> directory.  E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    /usr/autodesk/maya2008/include/maya/shaveAPI.h
</div>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut does not itself use this header file, so you may
freely relocate it to any directory.

<p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="osx">Installing Shave And A Haircut On OSX</a></h2>

<p>
<h3><a name="before-osx">Before Installation</a></h3>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut for OSX comes as a zipped OSX installation bundle,
with a name ending in <i>.pkg.zip</i>.  E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    shaveHaircut_Maya2008_0.pkg.zip
</div>
<p>
Make sure that the Maya version given in the filename (e.g. '2008_0') matches
the version of Maya for which you are installing Shave And A Haircut (e.g.
'2008').  For the remainder of this document we will assume that you are
installing Shave And A Haircut for Maya 2008.  If not, please remember to
adjust the Maya version numbers in any filenames or commands presented here
to match your version of Maya.
<p>
If any users on the system are currently running Maya, have them exit until
the installation is complete.
<p>
If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Shave And A Haircut, just
follow the same instructions as if you were installing for the first time.

<p>
<h3><a name="install-osx">Installing Shave And A Haircut</a></h3>
<p>
If you downloaded Shave And A Haircut using your web browser, depending
upon its configuration it may have automatically expanded the <i>.zip</i>
file into a <i>.mpkg</i> bundle.  If not, then try double-clicking on the
<i>.zip</i> file to see if that will expand it.  If that doesn't work
either, then open up a Terminal window, use the <i>cd</i> command to change
to whatever directory you downloaded the <i>.zip</i> file to, then use the
<i>unzip</i> command to expand it.  For example, if you downloaded the
<i>.zip</i> file to your desktop, then you would do something like this:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    cd Desktop
	<br>
	unzip shaveHaircut_Maya2008_0.pkg.zip
</div>
<p>
However you get there, you should eventually end up with a bundle ending in
<i>.mpkg</i>.  Unlike the <i>.zip</i> file, the bundle will also contain the
version of Shave in its name (e.g. <i>shaveHaircut_Maya2008_0-5.0v44.mpkg</i>).
Again, depending upon your settings, your browser may automatically launch
the OSX installer.  If not, then double-click on the bundle to launch the
installer.
<p>
The installer will first display a welcome window. Click on the <b>Continue</b>
button.
<p>
The next window will give you an opportunity to change where Shave will be
installed. To install to a non-default volume, such as a network drive, click
the <b>Change Install Location</b> button.
<p>
To change where individual components of Shave are installed, click the
<b>Customize</b> button. You will be presented with a window listing each
of Shave's three components: Maya Support Files, Plugin Files and API Samples.
You can choose not to install a given component by toggling off its checkbox,
however note that Shave requires the first two components for proper operation.
By clicking on the folder icon beside each component you can change the directory
where that component will be installed. In choosing an alternate location for
a component, keep the following in mind:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>mayaFiles</i> component must be installed in the same location as
Maya.</li>
<li>The <i>pluginFiles</i> component must be installed in a location where
Maya will be able to find it. See the section
on <a href="#relocate-osx">Relocating The Plugin Files Component</a> for more
details.</li>
<li>The <i>sampleFiles</i> component is optional and can go anywhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once you're ready to continue with the installation, click on the
<b>Install</b> button.  The Installer will prompt you for your password, or
that of System Administrator.  After supplying that, it will proceed to install
Shave And A Haircut. When it is done, click the <b>Close</b> button.

<p>
<h3><a name="mr-osx">Installing Mental Ray Standalone Support</a></h3>
<p>
Maya allows scenes to be exported as <i>.mi</i> files which can then be
rendered using a standalone Mental Ray renderer.
<p>
To have Shave And A Haircut support this workflow, you must copy the
following file to the <i>lib</i> subdirectory of your standalone
Mental Ray installation:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    /Applications/Autodesk/maya2008/Maya.app/Contents/mentalray/lib/shaveMRShader.so
</div>
<p>
Also copy the following file to the <i>include</i> subdirectory of
your standalone Mental Ray installation:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    /Applications/Autodesk/maya2008/Maya.app/Contents/mentalray/include/shaveMRShader.mi
</div>
<p>
If during installation you chose to install the "Maya Support Files" component
of Shave And A Haircut to a non-default location then you must adjust the
pathnames shown above accordingly.

<p>
<h3><a name="load-osx">Loading The Plugin</a></h3>
<p>
To use Shave And A Haircut from within Maya, bring up Maya's <i>Plug-in
Manager</i>, which can be found on the Maya menubar under <i>Window :
Settings/Preferences : Plug-in Manager</i>.
<p>
The Plug-in Manager will display its plugins in several sections. If
you installed the "Maya Support Files" component of Shave And A Haircut in its
default location then its plugin will be in a section bearing a name something
like this:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    /Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2008/plug-ins
</div>
<p>
If you installed the component elsewhere then the path in the header will differ
correspondingly.
<p>
Beneath that heading you should see an entry for <i>shaveNode.bundle</i>
with two checkboxes to the right of it, marked <i>Loaded</i> and
<i>Auto load</i>.
<p>
To load Shave And A Haircut, check the <i>Loaded</i> box.  To have Shave
And A Haircut automatically load whenever you start up Maya, also check the
<i>Auto load</i> box.

<p>
<h3><a name="uninstall-osx">Uninstalling Shave And A Haircut</a></h3>
<p>
Unfortunately, OSX's Installer does not support uninstalling
packages, so you must remove the files by hand.
<p>
If you look in your system's <b>/Library/Receipts</b> directory you should
see a bundle for each of Shave's three components. E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    shave_Maya2008-mayaFiles.pkg
	<br>
	shave_Maya2008-pluginFiles.pkg
	<br>
	shave_Maya2008-sampleFiles.pkg
</div>
<p>
In the Finder each of these bundles will appear as a single file and, depending
upon your settings, the <i>.pkg</i> extension may not be visible. From the
command line each bundle will appear as a directory.
<p>
Within each package there is a <b>Contents</b> directory containing a file
called <b>Archive.bom</b>. This contains a list of all the files which were
installed. You can display the list using the <i>lsbom</i> command. E.g:
<p>
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    lsbom /Library/Receipts/shave_Maya2008-mayaFiles.pkg/Contents/Archive.bom
</div>
<p>
All of the files will be listed relative to the directory in which the component
was installed.
<p>
Within the <b>Contents</b> directory there is another file named <b>Info.plist</b>.
This is an XML text file containing key/value pairs. Find the line which
contains the <b>IFPkgRelocatedPath</b> key and beneath that will be a line
giving the path to the directory where the component was installed. E.g:
<p>
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    &lt;key&gt;IFPkgRelocatedPath&lt;/key&gt;
	<br>
    &lt;string&gt;./Applications/Autodesk/maya2008/&lt;/string&gt;
</div>
<p>
With these two pieces of information you should be able to locate and delete
all of the files.
<p>
Note that if, during installation, you copied files by hand as described in
<a href="#mr-osx">Installing Mental Ray Standalone Support</a>, then you
will have to remove those files as well.
<p>

<p>
<h3><a name="remote-osx">Remote Installation</a></h3>
<p>
If you downloaded Shave And A Haircut as a zip file, you will first have to
unzip it. That will give you a bundle with a name ending in ".mpkg". E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    shaveHaircut_Maya2008_0-5.0v44.mpkg
</div>
<p>
In Finder the bundle will appear as a single file but from the command line you
will see that it is in fact a directory.
<p>
The <i>installer</i> command can be used to do command line installations
of the package without invoking a graphical user interface.  As such it is
well suited for use in remote and unattended installations.  Note that you
must have root privileges to use this command.
<p>
To install Shave And A Haircut in its default location you would
use a command something like this:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    /usr/sbin/installer -pkg shaveHaircut_Maya2008_0-5.0v44.mpkg -target /
</div>
<p>
The <i>-pkg</i> flag specifies the location of the of the package to be
installed and the <i>-target</i> flag specifies the disk volume where Maya is
installed, which is usually just the system root ('/').
<p>
If you want to install one or more of Shave's components in a non-default
location then you will have to install each of the components separately. To do this
you must first move into the <b>Contents/Packages</b> directory inside the
bundle. In there you will see a separate bundle for each of Shave's
three components. E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    shaveHaircut_Maya2008-mayaFiles.pkg
	<br>
    shaveHaircut_Maya2008-pluginFiles.pkg
	<br>
    shaveHaircut_Maya2008-sampleFiles.pkg
</div>
<p>
The <i>installer</i> command can be used to install each component separately.
In doing so you must use the <i>-target</i> flag to provide the full path
for the component. For example, let's say that you have Maya 2008 installed
in <b>/Volumes/Shared/Maya/2008</b>. You will have to provide that path when
installing the 'mayaFiles' component:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    /usr/sbin/installer -pkg shaveHaircut_Maya2008-mayaFiles.pkg -target /Volumes/Shared/Maya/2008
</div>
<p>
When choosing an alternate location for a component, keep the following in
mind:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>mayaFiles</i> component must be installed in the same location as
Maya.</li>
<li>The <i>pluginFiles</i> component must be installed in a location where
Maya will be able to find it. See the section
on <a href="#relocate-osx">Relocating The Plugin Files Component</a> for more
details.</li>
<li>The <i>sampleFiles</i> component is optional and can go anywhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Even if you wish for a component to be installed in its default
location, you will still have to provide the appropriate path. E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    /usr/sbin/installer&nbsp;-pkg&nbsp;shaveHaircut_Maya2008-pluginFiles.pkg&nbsp;-target&nbsp;/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2008
	<br>
    /usr/sbin/installer&nbsp;-pkg&nbsp;shaveHaircut_Maya2008-sampleFiles.pkg&nbsp;-target&nbsp;/Users/Shared/JoeAlter/shaveHaircut/maya2008
</div>
<p>

<p>
<h3><a name="relocate-osx">Relocating The Plugin Files Component</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>Plugin Files</i> component contains three subdirectories: <b>icons</b>,
<b>plug-ins</b> and <b>scripts</b>. For proper operation of Shave the <b>icons</b>
directory must be in Maya's <a href="#mayaVars">XBMLANGPATH</a>,
the <b>plug-ins</b> directory must be in Maya's
<a href="#mayaVars">MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH</a> and the
<b>scripts</b> directory must be in Maya's <a href="#mayaVars">MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH</a>.
<p>
By default the Plugin Files component is installed into Maya's
shared directory (e.g. /Users/Autodesk/maya/2008) because its subdirectories
are already included in the appropriate environment variables.
If you decide to install the component elsewhere then you must ensure that Maya
will know about the new locations of those three subdirectories. There are
two ways of doing this.
<p>
The simplest approach is to add each of the subdirectories to its corresponding
environment variable, for example by placing appropriate assignments into
each user's <b>Maya.env</b> file.
<p>
A more robust approach is to create a module file. This is a text file containing
a single line of text with the following format:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    + shaveHaircut [shaveVersion] [componentPath]
</div>
<p>
Replace <i>[shaveVersion]</i> with the version of shave your are installeing
and replace <i>[componentPath]</i> with the full path to where you have installed
the Plugin Files component. For example, if you are installing the Plugin
Files component of Shave 5.0v44 into <b>/Library/MayaPlugins</b> then the
module file would contain this:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    + shaveHaircut 5.0 /Library/MayaPlugins
</div>
<p>
Place this file in Maya's <b>modules</b> directory (e.g. /Applications/Autodesk/maya/2008/Maya.app/Contents/modules). Maya will automatically add the subdirectories
of the path specified in the module file to the correct environment variables.


<h3><a name="presets-osx">Relocating Presets</a></h3>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut includes a number of preset files which can be used to
quickly create hair with certain predefined looks, such as blond, grass,
scruffy, etc.  Each preset consists of a MEL script file and an XPM image file
containing a sample swatch.
<p>
These presets are intended to be available to all users on the system and
are normally stored with the rest of Maya's system-wide presets in the
<i>Contents</i> hierarchy of Maya's installation directory.  So for Maya 2008
the default location of the script file for Shave's <i>grass</i> preset
would be:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
	/Applications/Autodesk/maya2008/Maya.app/Contents/presets/attrPresets/shaveHair/grass.mel
</div>
<p>
When searching for these built-in presets Shave And A Haircut looks in the
following directories, in the order listed, from top to bottom:
<p>
<ul>
<li>${SHAVE_COMMON_PRESET_PATH}</li>
<li>${SHAVE_LOCATION}/presets/attrPresets/shaveHair</li>
<li>${MAYA_PRESET_PATH}/attrPresets/shaveHair</li>
<li>${MAYA_LOCATION}/presets/attrPresets/shaveHair</li>
</ul>
<p>
The syntax <i>${NAME}</i> refers to the expansion of the environment
variabled named <i>NAME</i>. Note that <i>${MAYA_PRESET_PATH}</i> may
expand to a list of directories in which case each is checked in turn.

<h2 align="center"><a name="windows">Installing Shave And A Haircut On Windows</a></h2>
<p>

<h3><a name="before-windows">Before Installation</a></h3>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut for Windows comes as an executable installer with a
filename something like this:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    shave-5.0v44-Release-Maya2008.exe
	<br>
	shave-5.0v44-Release-Maya2008x64.exe
</div>
<p>
The first is the version for 32-bit Maya, the second is the version for
64-bit Maya.
<p>
Make sure that the Maya version given in the filename matches
the version of Maya for which you are installing Shave And A Haircut (.e.g.
'2008' for 32-bit Maya 2008 or '2008x64' for 64-bit Maya 2008).
For the remainder of this document we will assume that you are installing
Shave And A Haircut for 32-bit Maya 2008.  If not, please remember to adjust
the version numbers in any filenames or commands presented here to match
your version of Maya.
<p>
If any users on the system are currently running Maya, have them exit until
the installation is complete.

<p>
<h3><a name="install-windows">Installing Shave And A Haircut</a></h3>
<p>
To install Shave And A Haircut, run the executable by double-clicking on
its filename.  This will launch the Shave And A Haircut installation wizard
which will guide you through the remainder of the installation process.

<p>
<h3><a name="mr-windows">Installing Mental Ray Standalone Support</a></h3>
<p>
Maya allows scenes to be exported as <i>.mi</i> files which can then be
rendered using a standalone Mental Ray renderer. To make use of Shave And
A Haircut in those standalone renders, copy the following file to the
<i>lib</i> subdirectory of your standalone Mental Ray installation:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Autodesk\maya2008\mentalray\lib\shaveMRShader.dll
</div>
<p>
and copy the following file to the <i>include</i> subdirectory of your
standalone Mental Ray installation:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Autodesk\maya2008\mentalray\include\shaveMRShader.mi
</div>

<p>
<h3><a name="prman-windows">Installing RenderMan Shaders</a></h3>
<p>
Shave has a single RenderMan shader called <i>Shave.slo</i>
which is installed into the <i>plug-ins/prman/lib/shaders</i> folder within
the JoeAlter tree. For example:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\JoeAlter\shaveHaircut\maya2008\plug-ins\prman\lib\shaders\Shave.slo
</div>
<p>
The current beta versions of RenderMan Studio and RenderMan for Maya do not
allow shaders to be located anywhere except in their own
<i>rmantree\lib\shaders</i> folder.
For example, if you have RenderMan Studio installed in:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Pixar\RenderMan-Studio-maya8.5
</div>
<p>
Then you will need to copy <i>Shave.slo</i> into this folder:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Pixar\RenderMan-Studio-maya8.5\rmantree\lib\shaders
</div>

<p>
<h3><a name="load-windows">Loading The Plugin</a></h3>
<p>
To use Shave And A Haircut from within Maya, bring up Maya's <i>Plug-in
Manager</i>, which can be found on the Maya menubar under <i>Window :
Settings/Preferences : Plug-in Manager</i>.
<p>
The Plug-in Manager will display its plugins in several sections.  Shave
And A Haircut will have its own section, bearing a name something like
this:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    C:/Program&nbsp;Files/JoeAlter/shaveHaircut/maya2008/plug-ins
</div>
<p>
Beneath that heading you should see an entry for the <i>shaveNode.mll</i>
file with two checkboxes to the right of it, marked <i>loaded</i> and
<i>auto load</i>.
<p>
To load Shave And A Haircut, check the <i>loaded</i> box.  To have Shave
And A Haircut automatically load whenever you start up Maya, also check the
<i>auto load</i> box.

<p>
<h3><a name="uninstall-windows">Uninstalling Shave And A Haircut</a></h3>
<p>
To uninstall Shave And A Haircut, run the <i>Add/Remove Programs</i>
utility, usually found on the Windows Control Panel.  Click on the entry
for <i>Shave And A Haircut For Maya</i> then click on the
<i>Change/Remove</i> button which appears.  This will launch an uninstaller
wizard, which will guide you through the remainder of the installation.
<p>
Note that if, during installation, you copied files by hand as described in
<a href="#mr-windows">Installing Mental Ray Standalone Support</a>, then you
will have to remove those files by hand.
<p>

<p>
<h3><a name="remote-windows">Remote Installation</a></h3>
<p>
The installer executable provides a "silent" mode of operation which
performs a default installation without using a graphical interface and
without requiring any user input.  As such it is well suited for use in
remote and unattended installations.
<p>
To access the silent mode, run the executable from the command line and
append the <i>/s</i> flag.  You'll also want to use the <i>/r</i> flag to
tell it not to prompt you about file conflicts but to just go ahead and
replace any existing files with those from the installer. E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    shave-5.0v44-Release-Maya2008.exe /s /r
</div>
<p>
Some System Administrators install Maya simply by copying its files from
another system.  This results in an installation for which there are no
entries in the Windows Registry.  The installer can handle this so long
as Maya has been installed in its standard location
(e.g. C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2008).  However, if there are no registry
entries and Maya has been installed in a non-standard location, then the
installation will fail.
<p>
If you run into this problem, you will have to explictly give the path
to the Maya installation directory on the command line, using the
'/var:MayaLocation=<path>' syntax.  E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    shave-5.0v44-Release-Maya2008.exe /s /r /var:MayaLocation="D:\Apps\Autodesk\Maya2008"
</div>

<p>
<h3><a name="relocate-windows">Relocating Files</a></h3>
<p>
For most users the standard locations used by Shave for its components
will be sufficient.  However, users with special needs may need to relocate
some or all of Shave's components to different locations on their
computer's disks, or on a network.
<p>
This section lists the various categories of files included in the
Shave And A Haircut installation, their default locations, and how to go
about relocating them to different folders.

<h4>Base Plugin And Scripts (required)</h4>
<p>
On Windows Shave And A Haircut is shipped as a Maya module.  This means
that there is a module definition file which points to a special folder
containing most of the files required by Shave And A Haircut.
Unfortunately, Maya does not yet support the modularization of runtime
libraries, presets, Mental Ray for Maya shaders, or shader icons, so those
elements of the plugin must be dealt with separately.
<p>
The module definition file for Shave And A Haircut is named
<i>shaveHaircut.mod</i> and is located in Maya's module folder for the
specific version of Maya for which it was installed.  For example:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Autodesk\Maya2008\modules\shaveHaircut.mod
</div>
<p>
By default, the module file will point to the
<i>JoeAlter\shaveHaircut\maya2008</i> folder, located in your system's
<i>Program Files</i> folder:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    C:\Program&nbsp;Files\JoeAlter\shaveHaircut\maya2008
</div>
<p>
Within that folder lie four sub-folders, containing plug-ins,
scripts, icons and Shave API sample files:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\JoeAlter\shaveHaircut\maya2008\plug-ins
  <br>
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\JoeAlter\shaveHaircut\maya2008\scripts
  <br>
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\JoeAlter\shaveHaircut\maya2008\samples
</div>
<p>
All except the sample files are required for the proper operation of Shave
And A Haircut.
<p>
The easiest way to relocate these files is to move the entire sub-tree, as
a unit, and modify the path in the <i>shaveHaircut.mod</i> file to point to
the new location.
<p>
The <i>shaveHaircut.mod</i> file itself may be relocated to any folder in
the user's <a href="#mayaVars">MAYA_MODULE_PATH</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, the files in the <i>plug-ins</i> sub-folder may be moved to
any folder which is in the user's <a href="#mayaVars">MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH</a>,
the files in the <i>scripts</i> sub-folder to any folder in the user's <a
href="#mayaVars">MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH</a>, and the files in the <i>icons</i>
sub-folder to any folder in the user's <a href="#mayaVars">XBMLANGPATH</a>.
The files in the <i>samples</i> sub-folder can go wherever you like.


<h4>Base Runtime Library (required)</h4>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut installs a library named <i>libShave.dll</i> to
which it must have access at runtime.  By default this file is placed in
Maya's <i>bin</i> folder along with Maya's own runtime libraries. E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Autodesk\Maya2008\bin\libShave.dll
</div>
<p>
You may relocate this library to any folder in the user's
<a href="#mayaVars">PATH</a>
<p>


<h4>Icons (recommended)</h4>
<p>
Some versions of Maya do not allow icons to be stored within the module
tree, so Shave And A Haircut installs its icons into Maya's own
<i>icons</i> folder. E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
	C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Autodesk\Maya2008\icons
</div>
<p>
Any files whose names begin with <i>shave</i> or <i>render_shave</i> are
part of the Shave And A Haircut plugin.
<p>
If these files are not present Maya will print warnings and buttons on the
Shave shelf will be displayed with a blank icon, as will any Shave-specific
buttons on the Hypershade and Create Render Node windows.  Other than that,
both Shave And A Haircut and Maya will still function properly.
<p>
In Maya 6.5 these files must remain in Maya's own <i>icons</i> directory.
In Maya 7.0 and later they can be relocated to any directory in the user's
<a href="#mayaVars">XBMLANGPATH</a>.
<p>


<h4>Presets (required)</h4>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut includes a number of preset files which can be used to
quickly create hair with certain predefined looks, such as blond, grass,
scruffy, etc.  Each preset consists of a MEL script file and an XPM image file
containing a sample swatch.
<p>
These presets are intended to be available to all users on the system and
are normally stored with the rest of Maya's system-wide presets in a
folder relative to Maya's installation directory.  So for Maya 2008 the
default location of the script file for Shave's <i>grass</i> preset would
be:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Autodesk\Maya2008\presets\attrPresets\shaveHair\grass.mel
</div>
<p>
When searching for these built-in presets Shave And A Haircut looks in the
following directories, in the order listed, from top to bottom:
<p>
<ul>
<li>${SHAVE_COMMON_PRESET_PATH}</li>
<li>${SHAVE_LOCATION}\presets\attrPresets\shaveHair</li>
<li>${MAYA_PRESET_PATH}\attrPresets\shaveHair</li>
<li>${MAYA_LOCATION}\presets\attrPresets\shaveHair</li>
</ul>
<p>
The syntax <i>${NAME}</i> refers to the expansion of the environment
variabled named <i>NAME</i>. Note that <i>${MAYA_PRESET_PATH}</i> may
expand to a list of directories in which case each is checked in turn.


<h4>Mental Ray Shaders (optional)</h4>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut's support for Mental Ray for Maya involves three files:
a shader definition file called <i>shaveMRShader.mi</i>, a shader library
file called <i>shaveMRShader.dll</i>, and the Mental Ray for Maya startup
file which is called <i>maya.rayrc</i>.  These files are installed within
the <i>mentalray</i> hierarchy beneath Maya's own installation folder.  For
Maya 2008, the files would be located as follows:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Autodesk\Maya2008\mentalray\include\shaveMRShader.mi
  <br>
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Autodesk\Maya2008\mentalray\lib\shaveMRShader.dll
  <br>
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Autodesk\Maya2008\mentalray\maya.rayrc
</div>
<p>
The first two files are installed by Shave And A Haircut.  The third is
installed by Maya and modified by the Shave And A Haircut installer.  They
are only required if you wish to use Mental Ray for Maya to render scenes
containing hair generated by Shave And A Haircut.
<p>
The locations of these files are mandated by Maya and, to the best of our
knowledge, cannot be relocated elsewhere except by moving all of Maya.


<h4>RenderMan Shaders (optional)</h4>
<p>
Shave has a single RenderMan shader called <i>Shave.slo</i>
which is installed into the <i>plug-ins/prman/lib/shaders</i> folder within
the JoeAlter tree. For example:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\JoeAlter\shaveHaircut\maya2008\plug-ins\prman\lib\shaders\Shave.slo
</div>
<p>
The current beta versions of RenderMan Studio and RenderMan for Maya do not
allow shaders to be located anywhere except in their own
<i>rmantree\lib\shaders</i> folder.
For example, if you have RenderMan Studio installed in:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Pixar\RenderMan-Studio-maya8.5
</div>
<p>
Then you will need to copy <i>Shave.slo</i> into this folder:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
  C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Pixar\RenderMan-Studio-maya8.5\rmantree\lib\shaders
</div>


<h4>Shave API Plugins (optional)</h4>
<p>
Third-party plugins developed using the Shave And A Haircut API will
require the presence of the <i>libShaveAPI.dll</i> runtime library, which
by default can be found in Maya's own <i>bin</i> folder. E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
	C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Autodesk\Maya2008\bin\libShaveAPI.dll
</div>
<p>
If you are using third-party plugins built with the Shave And A Haircut API
and need to relocate this file, the folder to which you relocate it must
be in the user's <a href="#mayaVars">PATH</a>.
<p>
Note that Shave And A Haircut does not itself use this file.
<p>

<h4>Shave API Development (optional)</h4>
<p>
Developers wishing to create their own plugins which use the Shave And A
Haircut API will need access to the <i>libShaveAPI.dll</i> runtime library
described in the previous section, as well as its associated header file,
<i>shaveAPI.h</i>.  By default this file is located within Maya's own
<i>include</i> folder.  E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
    C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Autodesk\Maya2008\include\maya\shaveAPI.h
</div>
<p>
Shave And A Haircut does not itself use this header file, so you may
freely relocate it to any folder.

<hr>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="mayaVars">Maya Environment Variables</a></h2>
<p>
If you don't know which directories are pointed to by a given Maya
environment variable, such as <i>MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH</i>, then start up Maya
and in the Script Editor window and use the <i>getenv</i> command on the
variable name. E.g:
<div style="margin-left:2em;font-family:monospace;font-size:large">
getenv MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH
</div>
<p>
Maya will display a single line containing all of the directories that Maya
will search for, in this case, plug-ins.
