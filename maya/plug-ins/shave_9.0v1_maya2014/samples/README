Shave And A Haircut APIs
------------------------
There are two APIs for use with Shave: a standalone API for building
applications which process Shave archive files (such as those produced by
the 'shaveRender -createDRAFile' command in Maya), and a plugin API for
building Maya plugins which can access Shave's data from within Maya.


Standalone API
--------------
The standalone API consists of the following two header files, found in this
directory:

	shaveEngine.h
	shaveSDKTYPES.h

as well as the following dynamic library and its corresponding link
library, both also found in this directory:

	libShaveEngine.dll
	libShaveEngine.lib

To use the DLL library you must either place it in a folder which is in
your PATH, or else add the folder it is currently in to your PATH.


Sample Application
------------------
'shaveAPITestApp.cpp' is a sample application using Shave's standalone API.

Project files have been provided for building the plugin under Visual
C++ 6.0 and Visual C++.NET 7.0:

	Visual C++
	Version		Project Files		Configurations
	----------	-------------		-------------
	   6.0		shaveAPISamples.dsw	Debug/Release
			shaveAPITestApp.dsp

	   7.0		shaveAPISamples.sln	Debug/Release
			shaveAPITestApp.vcproj


Maya Plugin API
---------------
The Maya plugin API consists of the following two header files, found in the
same directory as Maya's own API header files
(e.g. c:\Program Files\Alias\maya7.0\include\maya):

	shaveAPI.h
	shaveItHair.h

as well as the following dynamic library, found in Maya's 'bin' directory
(e.g. c:\Program Files\Alias\maya7.0\bin):

	libShaveAPI.dll

The associated link library is in Maya's 'lib' directory
(e.g. c:\Program Files\Alias\maya7.0\lib):

	libShaveAPI.lib

The header files contain complete documentation on the plugin API.


Sample Plugin
-------------
'shaveAPITestCmd.cpp' is a sample Maya plugin using Shave's plugin API.

Project files have been provided for building the plugin under Visual
C++ 6.0 and Visual C++.NET 7.0.

Within each project file are separate configurations for the different Maya
versions supported by Shave:

    Maya	Visual C++
  Version	  Version	Project Files		Configurations
  --------	----------	-------------		-------------
  5.0/5.0.1	   6.0		shaveAPISamples.dsw	Debug50/Release50
	     			shaveAPITestCmd.dsp

    6.0		   7.0		shaveAPISamples.sln	Debug60/Release60
	     			shaveAPITestCmd.vcproj

    6.5		   7.0		shaveAPISamples.sln	Debug65/Release65
				shaveAPITestCmd.vcproj

    7.0		   7.0		shaveAPISamples.sln	Debug70/Release70
				shaveAPITestCmd.vcproj

To build the sample plugin for a specific version of Maya, you must have the
corresponding environment variable defined and pointing to the directory in
which that version of Maya is installed.

For example, if you want to build the 'Release70' version of the
shaveAPITestCmd plugin, you would need to have an environment variable named
MAYA_7_0_LOCATION defined and pointing to the directory where Maya 7.0 is
installed (e.g. C:\Program Files\Alias\Maya7.0)
