1. Place the needed Yeti version (folder) into C:\

	(e.g. C:\Yeti-v2.0.19_Maya2015-windows64)


2. Put yeti.lic to C:\rlm


3. Create (or edit, if needed) a Windows User Environment Variable:

	peregrinel_LICENSE = C:\rlm\yeti.lic


If you really like it and use it in production, be sure to support the devs and buy it.

N-joy.
